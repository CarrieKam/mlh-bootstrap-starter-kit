# MLH INIT BOOstrap Starter Pack
This sis my starter pack that helps people to get into using Boostrap! You can clone it and it will give you a basic Boostrap that you can use for a hackathon!

Feel free to edit it as u need!

## How do I use this?
You should clone this repo (or download it as a .zip file) to your computer. If you download it as a .zip you'll need to uncompress (open) it. You can then open the folder in any code editor, including VS Code and Atom.
